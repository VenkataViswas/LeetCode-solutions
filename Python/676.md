# 676. Implement Magic Dictionary

## Solution 1

```python
class MagicDictionary(object):

    def __init__(self):
        pass


    def buildDict(self, dictionary):
        """
        :type dictionary: List[str]
        :rtype: None
        """
        self.dictionary = dictionary


    def search(self, searchWord):
        """
        :type searchWord: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        for word in self.dictionary:
            if len(word) != len(searchWord):
                continue
            diff = 0
            for i in range(len(word)):
                if word[i] != searchWord[i]:
                    diff += 1
                if diff > 1:
                    break
            if diff == 1:
                return True
        return False

# Your MagicDictionary object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MagicDictionary()
# obj.buildDict(dictionary)
# param_2 = obj.search(searchWord)
```
