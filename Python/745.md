```python

        :type words: List[str]
        """
        self.d = {}
        for i, word in enumerate(words):
            m = len(word)
            for t1 in range(1, m + 1):
                for t2 in range(1, m + 1):
                    self.d[word[:t1] + "#" + word[-t2:]] = i

    def f(self, pref, suff):
        """
        :type pref: str
        :type suff: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        return self.d.get(pref + "#" + suff, -1)


# Your WordFilter object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = WordFilter(words)
# param_1 = obj.f(pref,suff)
